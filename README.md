Introduction
============

This is a C++ example repository that I am collecting, so it can be referred by me (mostly) or other people. You may find some useful usages or concepts here, and you can also contribute greater examples!

Each example should be compiled and run alone. The examples can be run as a whole by the script `run_exams.sh`, which will call `cmake` and `make` to compile examples and run the executables.

Note
====

You need to install [MLPACK](http://www.mlpack.org/index.html) to run the examples under `src/UseLibraries/MLPACK`.
